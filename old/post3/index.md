This is my personal reading list in which I collect and summarize the most interesting articles I have read during the last week. I save both news articles on present events and older articles.



## News



### Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Stoked Washington’s Fears About TikTok

[*from Gizmodo, 03/09/20*](https://gizmodo.com/president-trump-tells-supporters-to-commit-felony-by-vo-1844939138)

President Donald Trump [...] told his supporters on Wednesday to vote twice—once with an absentee mail-in ballot and again at a polling station. Trump implied that attempting to vote twice was just a way to test how secure the mail-in voting system will be during the upcoming presidential election, despite the fact that voting twice is a felony under U.S. law.



### Walmart Takes On Amazon Prime: Membership Program Will Deliver From Stores

[*from NPR, 01/09/20*](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/01/908299536/walmart-takes-on-amazon-prime-membership-program-will-deliver-from-stores?t=1599040639052&t=1599548659863)

Walmart is officially launching a new rival to Amazon Prime: an annual membership service giving shoppers free delivery of groceries and other perks. Walmart+ will cost \$98 a year or ​\$12.95 a month. Its offer centers on free delivery of food and other items from nearby stores "as fast as same-day." Other perks, which the company expects to expand, include a discount on gas at the company's stations and the ability to pay by mobile phone to skip checkout lines at stores.



### Russians Again Targeting Americans With Disinformation, Facebook and Twitter Say

[*from The New York Times, 01/09/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/technology/facebook-russia-disinformation-election.html)

The Russian group that interfered in the 2016 presidential election is at it again, using a network of fake accounts and a website set up to look like a left-wing news site, Facebook and Twitter said on Tuesday. The disinformation campaign by the Kremlin-backed group, known as the Internet Research Agency, is the first public evidence that the agency is trying to repeat its efforts from four years ago and push voters away from the Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., to help President Trump.



### Amazon Announces Halo, a Fitess Band and App that Scans your Body and Voice

[*from The Verge, 27/08/20*](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep)

AmazonAmazon is getting into the health gadget market with a new fitness band and subscription service called Halo. Unlike the Apple Watch or even most basic Fitbits, the Amazon Halo Band doesn’t have a screen. The app that goes along with it comes with the usual set of fitness tracking features along with two innovative — and potentially troubling — ideas: using your camera to create 3D scans for body fat and listening for the emotion in your voice.



### Longitudinal Study on Unconditional Basic Income Launches in Germany

[*from Der Spiegel, 26/08/20*](https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-1-200-euro-experiment-longitudinal-study-on-unconditional-basic-income-launches-in-germany-a-ba6541aa-dddd-4355-9559-a4ab0b6f7655)

How would life change if you were given 1,200 euros a month with no strings attached? A study launched last week in Germany to find out. Research team leader Jürgen Schupp hopes for answers to important questions. [...] For three years, 120 people are to receive 1,200 euros per month, and throughout the study period, they will be closely observed and frequently interviewed, as will the 1,380 members of the control group, who will receive no money.

### An MIT Lab Is Building Devices to Hack Your Dreams

[*from Medium, 13/04/20*](https://onezero.medium.com/an-mit-lab-is-building-devices-to-hack-your-dreams-d1a10ff932e3)

The Dream Lab, which was launched in 2017 as a division of MIT’s Media Lab Fluid Interfaces Group, is developing novel and open source wearable devices that track and interact with dreams in various ways. While part of this work aims to legitimize the idea that dreams are not just random mind slush, but access points to deeper levels of cognition, the larger goal is to show that when dreams can be hacked, augmented, and swayed, our waking lives benefit.



### Switzerland’s teenage pseudoscience queen

[*from Coda Story, 03/09/20*](https://www.codastory.com/waronscience/switzerland-pseudoscience-queen/)

In recent years, Von Dreien has become a leading light of the Swiss New Age scene and a highly lucrative brand. The Swiss media frequently refer to her as an “esoteric star.” On her website, she describes herself as being “blessed with a multidimensional awareness and other paranormal abilities.” Von Dreien has made her career by sharing these self-proclaimed gifts with the world, via various social media channels, at speaking engagements and in writing. Looking at the comments on her website, it appears that her audience is mainly composed of middle-class, white women with an interest in spiritual growth and self-improvement.



### The Unbuilt Streets of California's Ghost Metropolis

[*from Wired, 09/05/19*](https://www.wired.com/story/california-ghost-metropolis-gallery/)

Although it's officially California's third-largest city based on its geographic size, today just under 15,000 people live there, many of them employed at the California City Correctional Center. All that remains of Mendelsohn's Ozymandian vision is a sprawling grid of empty, mostly unpaved streets carved into the desert landscape—a ghost suburb that looks from above like the remains of an ancient civilization.



### Evangelicals are looking for answers online. They’re finding QAnon instead.

[*from MIT Tech Review, 26/08/20*](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/26/1007611/how-qanon-is-targeting-evangelicals/)

That conspiracy-fueled frenzy was propelled in part by credulous mainstream news coverage, and by false accusations and even convictions of day-care owners. But evangelicals, in particular, embraced the claims, tuning in to a wave of televangelists who promised to help viewers spot secret satanic symbols and rituals in the secular world. 



### To Pay Attention, the Brain Uses Filters, Not a Spotlight

[*from Quanta, 24/09/2019*](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-pay-attention-the-brain-uses-filters-not-a-spotlight-20190924/?fbclid=IwAR331EQR6EOMq91EI1hsFq9NIgECY12-bCkrVBVrNtW0KYqKucGyK6Eqr5k)

Attentional processes are the brain’s way of shining a searchlight on relevant stimuli and filtering out the rest. Neuroscientists want to determine the circuits that aim and power that searchlight. For decades, their studies have revolved around the cortex, the folded structure on the outside of the brain commonly associated with intelligence and higher-order cognition. It’s become clear that activity in the cortex boosts sensory processing to enhance features of interest.
