This is my personal reading list in which I collect and summarize the most interesting articles I have read during the last week. I save both news articles on present events and older articles.



## News

### Trump's Taxes Show Chronic Losses and Years of Income Tax Avoidance

[*from the New York Times, 27/09/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)

Donald J. Trump paid 750 dollars in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another 750 dollars. He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.



### Reddit Squashed QAnon by Accident

[*from The Atlantic, 23/09/20*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/09/reddit-qanon-ban-evasion-policy-moderation-facebook/616442/)

Two years ago, most Americans knew nothing about QAnon, the ever-growing, diffuse, and violent movement devoted to a loosely connected set of conspiracy theories, most of which tie back to the idea that Donald Trump is leading a holy war against a high-powered cabal of child traffickers, some of whom drink blood. [...] Last week, new polling showed that nearly half of Americans have now heard of QAnon. But on Reddit, the movement no longer has any meaningful presence.



### Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, UBS Give Impetus to Bank Deal Talk

[*from Bloomberg, 22/09/20*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-22/deutsche-bank-cfo-signals-preference-for-cross-border-mergers)

Deutsche Bank AG Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke on Tuesday signaled the German lender is interested in cross-border mergers when consolidation in European banking takes off. Sergio Ermotti, the chief executive officer of UBS Group AG, said the pandemic has made it clear that deals need to happen, comments that were echoed by his counterpart at Credit Suisse Group AG.



### Microsoft exclusively licenses OpenAI’s groundbreaking GPT-3 text generation model

[*from The Verge, 22/09/20*](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research)

Microsoft’s ongoing partnership with San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research company OpenAI now includes a new exclusive license on the AI firm’s groundbreaking GPT-3 language model, an auto-generating text program that’s emerged as the most sophisticated of its kind in the industry.



### FinCEN Files: Roman Abramovich had secret stakes in rival players

[*from The BBC, 21/09/20*](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54229269)

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich held secret investments in footballers not owned by his club, an investigation has discovered. The players included the Peruvian winger Andre Carrillo, who turned out against Chelsea in Champions League matches in 2014. He held rights in the players through a company based in the British Virgin Islands.

### Life’s purpose rests in our mind’s spectacular drive to extract meaning from the world

[*from The Conversation, 04/09/20*](https://theconversation.com/lifes-purpose-rests-in-our-minds-spectacular-drive-to-extract-meaning-from-the-world-96665)

What is the purpose of life? Whatever you may think is the answer, you might, from time to time at least, find your own definition unsatisfactory. After all, how can one say why any living creature is on Earth in just one simple phrase? For me, looking back on 18 years of research into how the human brain handles language, there seems to be only one, solid, resilient thread that prevails over all others. Humanity’s purpose rests in the spectacular drive of our minds to extract meaning from the world around us.



### Yevgeny Prigozhin, Russian Oligarch Indicted by U.S., Is Known as ‘Putin’s Cook’

[*from The New York Times, 16/02/18*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html)

Long before he was indictedby the United States in a case involving the troll factory that spearheaded Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 United States elections, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin emerged from prison just as the Soviet Union was collapsing and opened a hot-dog stand.



### How Angela Merkel’s great migrant gamble paid off

[*from The Guardian, 30/08/20*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/30/angela-merkel-great-migrant-gamble-paid-off)

“I put it simply, Germany is a strong country,” the German chancellor told the media at a press conference in central Berlin on 31 August 2015, trying to address concerns about the steeply rising number of people – mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan – applying for asylum in Germany that summer. “The motive with which we approach these matters must be: we have already managed so much, we’ll manage this.”



### Mark Zuckerberg personally approved cutting off Vine’s friend-finding feature

[*from The Verge, 05/12/18*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents)

“Twitter launched Vine today, which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video,” Osofsky wrote. “Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today.” “Yup, go for it,” replied Zuckerberg, according to the documents.



### Investors Want a Cure, Not a Winner

[*from Bloomberg, 24/04/20*](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-24/investors-want-a-cure-not-a-winner)

Big investors, who own every public company, are less interested in the relative performance of any one company, and more interested in the performance of companies—and the economy—in general. They do not particularly care which company wins in cutthroat competition with other companies; they care about all of the companies doing okay.
