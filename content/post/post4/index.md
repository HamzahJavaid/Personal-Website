This is my personal reading list in which I collect and summarize the most interesting articles I have read during the last week. I save both news articles on present events and older articles.

It can be hard to tell a difference between AirPods and the many earbuds that resemble them, but checking the box is always a good start. US Customs and Border Protection tonight tweeted that its officers had “recently seized 2,000 counterfeit Apple AirPods from Hong Kong, valued at $398K had they been genuine.”

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has told Donald Trump that the kingdom is eager to achieve a fair and permanent solution to the Palestinian issue, which he said was the main starting point of the kingdom’s proposed Arab Peace Initiative, the state news agency reported.



### Amazon's profits, AWS and advertising

[*from Ben Evan's blog, 06/09/20*](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/9/6/amazons-profits)

People argue about Amazon a lot, and one of the most common and long-running arguments is about profits. The sales keep going up, and it takes a larger and larger share of US retail every year (7-8% in 2019), but it never seems to make any money. What’s going on?



## Old Articles

### Big Tech Funds a Think Tank Pushing for Fewer Rules. For Big Tech

[from The New York Times, 24/07/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/technology/global-antitrust-institute-google-amazon-qualcomm.html)

Regulatory scrutiny is, unquestionably, a global issue for tech companies. Until recently, Europe was the main threat of antitrust action. Google has lost three competition cases there since 2017. Amazon is now the target of an inquiry in Europe for abusing its dominance in online commerce to squeeze smaller rivals. Qualcomm has paid more than $1 billion in fines to Europe for its anticompetitive behavior.

Many Americans say the creation and spread of made-up news and information is causing significant harm to the nation and needs to be stopped, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 6,127 U.S. adults conducted between Feb. 19 and March 4, 2019, on the Center’s American Trends Panel.



### The Clocklike Regularity of Major Life Changes

[*from The Atlantic, 10/09/20*](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/09/major-life-changes-happen-clocklike-regularity/616243/)

Transitions are some of the most difficult periods in our lives. Even when we choose them, the disequilibrium they bring can be painful or frightening; when they are imposed upon us, they are even more distressing.



### The last Nazi hunters

[*from The Guardian, 31/08/17*](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/31/the-last-nazi-hunters)

Since it was created by the West German government in 1958, the Central Office’s mission has been to deliver Nazis to justice. Every year, its six investigative “departments,” each of which consists of a single prosecutor, scour the globe looking for members of the Third Reich. 



### When the World Isn’t Designed for Our Bodies

[*from The New Yorker, 03/09/20*](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/when-the-world-isnt-designed-for-our-bodies)
