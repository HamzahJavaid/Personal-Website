Two studies of the 2018 midterm elections in Florida and Georgia found that young and minority voters are especially likely to have their mail ballots rejected.

When the Italian news agency Ansa asked Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Vatican’s secretary for relations with states, if the US unilaterally organising the event amounted to exploitation of the pope in the run-up to the elections, he replied: “Yes, that is precisely why the pope will not meet American secretary of state Mike Pompeo.”

[*from The Fast Company, 30/09/20*](https://www.fastcompany.com/90555442/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-zuckerberg-privacy-integration)

On September 29, Facebook introduced Accounts Center, a one-stop hub—still in test mode—where users can view and change settings across Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram, including the ability to log into each service and automatically cross-post among them. Now it’s also beginning to push out a new version of Instagram’s messaging features that’s based on Messenger rather being its own self-contained entity. Users on both services will be able to chat with Messenger and Instagram friends from either app.

Back in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government began revising nationwide curriculums to reduce student workloads.

### What’s the Plan if Trump Tweets That He’s Won Re-election?

[*from The New York Times, 27/09/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/opinion/social-media-trump-election.html)

In 2016, when Donald Trump accepted Hillary Clinton’s concession, he was leading the popular vote count by nearly one million votes.

### QAnon explained: the antisemitic conspiracy theory gaining traction around the world

[*from The Guardian, 25/08/20*](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/25/qanon-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump-what-is)

So what is QAnon? “QAnon” is a baseless internet conspiracy theory whose followers believe that a cabal of Satan-worshipping Democrats, Hollywood celebrities and billionaires runs the world while engaging in pedophilia, human trafficking and the harvesting of a supposedly life-extending chemical from the blood of abused children. QAnon followers believe that Donald Trump is waging a secret battle against this cabal and its “deep state” collaborators to expose the malefactors and send them all to Guantánamo Bay.
