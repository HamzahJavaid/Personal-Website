This is my personal reading list in which I collect and summarize the most interesting articles I have read during the last week. I save both news articles on present events and older articles.


## News

### Apple’s move to make advertising harder on iOS 14 is part of a trend

[*from The Verge, 27/08/20*](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising)

Starting with iOS 14, which will ship this fall, Apple will begin requiring that developers show you a warning that they are collecting your IDFA [Identification for Advertisers], and you’ll have to opt in to sharing it. Some large percentage of users can be expected to say “no thanks.”



### Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Stoked Washington’s Fears About TikTok

[*from The Wall Street Journal, 23/08/20*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-stoked-washingtons-fears-about-tiktok-11598223133)

When Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app TikTok. [...] Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok’s travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese owners.



### Big Tech’s Domination of Business Reaches New Heights

[*from The New York Times, 20/08/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/technology/big-tech-business-domination.html)

A rally in technology stocks elevated the S&P 500 stock index to a record high on Tuesday even as the pandemic crushes the broader economy. The stocks of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, the five largest publicly traded companies in America, rose 37 percent in the first seven months this year, while all the other stocks in the S&P 500 fell a combined 6 percent, according to Credit Suisse.



### Apple, Epic, and the App Store

[*from Statechery, 17/08/20*](https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/)

There is a bit of a running joke in tech that the mainstream media believes that every tech company is ridiculously over-valued right up until the day that the exact same company is a juggernaut that is killing industries; in the case of Apple, the company’s strategy was doomed right up until it was illegal, or so it seems with the App Store.



### Nile Be Dammed

[*from Foreign Affairs, 10/08/20*](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2020-08-10/nile-be-dammed)

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is now a fait accompli. Last month, Ethiopia began filling an enormous reservoir behind the $4.5 billion hydroelectric project, which promises to make the country an energy powerhouse. [...] But ever since Ethiopia began construction in 2011, the dam has strained relations in the Nile River basin. Egypt considers the GERD an existential threat: the country depends on the Nile for nearly all of its fresh water and has enjoyed hegemony over the Nile basin for more than 60 years.



## Old Articles

### The Panopticon Is Already Here

[*from The Atlantic, 09/20*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/china-ai-surveillance/614197/)

Despite China’s considerable strides, industry analysts expect America to retain its current AI lead for another decade at least. But this is cold comfort: China is already developing powerful new surveillance tools, and exporting them to dozens of the world’s actual and would-be autocracies. Over the next few years, those technologies will be refined and integrated into all-encompassing surveillance systems that dictators can plug and play.



### The Pinterest Paradox: Cupcakes and Toxicity

[*from Medium, 11/08/20*](https://medium.com/digital-diplomacy/the-pinterest-paradox-cupcakes-and-toxicity-57ed6bd76960)

Although 70 percent of Pinterest’s users are women, the company is steered by men with little input from female executives. Pinterest’s female executives, even at the highest levels, are marginalized, excluded, and silenced. I know because until my firing in April, I was Pinterest’s chief operating officer.



### Life Without the Tech Giants

[*from Gizmodo, 22/01/19*](https://gizmodo.com/life-without-the-tech-giants-1830258056)

This is a story of how, over six weeks, I cut them out of my own life and tried to prevent them from knowing about me or monetizing me in any way—not just by putting my iPhone in a drawer for a week or only buying local, but by really, truly blocking these companies from accessing me and vice versa. I wanted to find out how hard it would be—or if I could even do it—given that these tech giants dominate the internet in so many invisible ways that it’s hard to even know them all.



### Enough With the Trolley Problem

[*from The Atlantic, 30/08/18*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/got-99-problems-but-a-trolley-aint-one/556805/)

There’s a problem with the trolley problem. It does a remarkably bad job addressing the moral conditions of robot cars, ships, or workers, the domains to which it is most popularly applied today. Deploying it for those ends, especially as a source of answers or guidance for engineering or policy, leads to incomplete and dangerous conclusions about the ethics of machines.



### How Years of Ruthless Nuclear Testing in the South Pacific Forged America’s Most Impoverished Ethnic Group

[*from Narratively, 17/07/17*](https://narratively.com/how-years-of-ruthless-nuclear-testing-in-the-south-pacific-forged-americas-most-impoverished-ethnic-group/)

Between 1946 and 1958, the United States tested 67 nuclear bombs on or near two atolls at the northern end of the Marshall Islands – an area that became known as the Pacific Proving Grounds. [...] On neighboring islands, many health effects were immediate: radiation burns, damage to stomach linings, low blood cell counts. Others surfaced gradually in the following months and years. Rates of leukemia, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer rose. Children were born deformed, or had their growth stunted.
