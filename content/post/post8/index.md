This is my personal reading list in which I collect and summarize the most interesting articles I have read during the last week. I save both news articles on present events and older articles.



## News

### The Biggest Risk to This Election Is Not Russia. It’s Us.

[*from The New York Times, 07/10/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/opinion/trump-russia-election-interference.html)

Truth is, the idea that Russia determined the election is overstated. It would never have resonated so loudly without our deep polarization — and our structural issues, including the vast discrepancy between the popular vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton and the narrow Electoral College win for Mr. Trump. [...] Today, we are even more fractured than in 2016. What was then a vulnerability is now a full-blown national security crisis.



### Debt Collectors Have Made a Fortune This Year. Now They’re Coming for More

[*from ProPublica, 05/10/20*](https://www.propublica.org/article/debt-collectors-have-made-a-fortune-this-year-now-theyre-coming-for-more)

The CARES Act [...] delivered hundreds of billions of dollars worth of stimulus checks and bulked-up unemployment benefits to Americans, while easing pressures on them by halting foreclosures, evictions and student loan payments. There was no ban on collections of old credit card bills [...]. At the same time, the pandemic compelled households to cut spending. Finding themselves with enough money to settle old debts, people responded to collectors’ calls and letters. Debt-buying executives couldn’t help marveling at their good fortune. 



### Colleges Are Fueling the Pandemic in a Classic Market Failure

[*from The New York Times, 08/10/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/colleges-pandemic-market-failure.html)

Colleges, and college towns, are designed to maximize social interaction, generating personal and professional opportunities for a lifetime. But in a pandemic, the brainstorming, talking, networking and socializing create negative externalities, so colleges have tried using norms and punishments to stop students from gathering. They have expelled violators and trained peers to model safe behavior.



### Apple made ProtonMail add in-app purchases, even though it had been free for years

[*from The Verge, 09/10/20*](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap)

One app developer revealed to Congress that it — just like WordPress — had been forced to monetize a largely *free* app. That developer testified that Apple had demanded in-app purchases (IAP), even though Apple had approved its app without them two years earlier — and that when the dev dared send an email to customers notifying them of the change, Apple threatened to remove the app and blocked all updates.



### Andrea Coscelli calls for new digital markets regulatory regime

[*from gov.uk, 09/10/20*](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/andrea-coscelli-calls-for-new-digital-markets-regulatory-regime)

Andrea Coscelli, CEO of the CMA, has spoken today at New York’s Fordham University about the need for digital reform and the latest thinking on a new regulatory regime.



## Old Articles

### Why It's Hard to Escape Amazon's Long Reach

[*from Wired, 23/12/18*](https://www.wired.com/story/why-hard-escape-amazons-long-reach/)

The company is known as the “everything store,” but in its dogged pursuit of growth, Amazon has come to dominate more than just ecommerce. It’s now the largest provider of cloud computing services and a maker of home security systems. Amazon is a fashion designer, advertising business, television and movie producer, book publisher, and the owner of a sprawling platform for crowdsourced micro-labor tasks. The company now occupies roughly as much space worldwide as 38 Pentagons. 



### Is It OK to Reveal Your Anxiety or Depression to Your Boss?

[*from The Wall Street Journal, 13/09/20*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-it-ok-to-reveal-your-anxiety-or-depression-to-your-boss-11599998400)

Some bosses are revealing vulnerabilities—such as a personal story from the CEO during an all-hands meeting or a crying child on a Zoom call—and asking, “How are you?” in a way that indicates they don’t expect a rote upbeat response. So, should you answer honestly? And, if you are struggling with a mental-health issue, should you seek an accommodation such as a different schedule, extended remote work or a leave of absence?



### This Overlooked Variable Is the Key to the Pandemic

[*from The Atlantic, 30/09/20*](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/)

A recent paper found that in Hong Kong, which had extensive testing and contact tracing, about 19 percent of cases were responsible for 80 percent of transmission, while 69 percent of cases did not infect another person. This finding is not rare: Multiple studiesfrom the beginning have suggested that as few as 10 to 20 percent of infected people may be responsible for as much as 80 to 90 percent of transmission, and that many people barely transmit it.



### The Dark Side of Smart

[*from Nautilus, 15/09/20*](http://nautil.us/blog/the-dark-side-of-smart)

Manipulative communication surrounds us. With misinformation and disinformation about the pandemic, “cheap” and “deep” fakes of elected officials, and targeted ads and emotionally exploitative social media algorithms, it can begin to feel like all communication is manipulation. 



### Elderly and Homeless: America’s Next Housing Crisis

[*from The New York Times, 30/09/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/magazine/homeless-seniors-elderly.html)

Last year, after analyzing historical records of shelter admissions in three major American cities, a team of researchers led by Dennis P. Culhane [...] published a sobering projection: In the next 10 years, the number of elderly people experiencing homelessness in the United States would nearly triple, as a wave of baby boomers who have historically made up the largest share of the homeless population ages. And that was before a pandemic arrived to stretch what remains of the social safety net to the breaking point.
