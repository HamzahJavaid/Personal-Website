Over the weekend Nvidia consummated the biggest chip deal in history when it acquired Arm from Softbank for around $40 billion in stock and cash.

### Venus: Possible signs of life discovered on planet

[*from The Independent, 15/09/20*](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/venus-alien-life-signs-phosphine-nasa-today-b436565.html)

Possible signs of life have been detected on Venus. Researchers have spotted phosphine, a rare and toxic gas, in the atmosphere of our neighbouring planet, suggesting that it may be home to alien life. The discovery is not a direct observation of life on another planet. But the sheer quantity of phosphine on Venus cannot be explained through any known process, leading researchers to suggest that it is a sign of alien life in our solar system.



## Old Articles

### Forget TikTok. China’s Powerhouse App Is WeChat, and Its Power Is Sweeping.

[*from The New York Times, 04/09/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/technology/wechat-china-united-states.html)

For most Chinese people in China, WeChat is a sort of all-in-one app: a way to swap stories, talk to old classmates, pay bills, coordinate with co-workers, post envy-inducing vacation photos, buy stuff and get news. For the millions of members of China’s diaspora, it is the bridge that links them to the trappings of home, from family chatter to food photos.



### Cognitive Ability and Vulnerability to Fake News

[*from Scientific American, 06/02/18*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cognitive-ability-and-vulnerability-to-fake-news/)

A study recently published in the journal *Intelligence* suggests that some people may have an especially difficult time rejecting misinformation. Asked to rate a fictitious person on a range of character traits, people who scored low on a test of cognitive ability continued to be influenced by damaging information about the person even after they were explicitly told the information was false. 



### A robot wrote this entire article. Are you scared yet, human?

### The Billion-Dollar Disinformation Campaign to Reelect the President

[*from The Atlantic, 03/20*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-2020-disinformation-war/605530/)

One day last fall, I sat down to create a new Facebook account. I picked a forgettable name, snapped a profile pic with my face obscured, and clicked “Like” on the official pages of Donald Trump and his reelection campaign. Facebook’s algorithm prodded me to follow Ann Coulter, Fox Business, and a variety of fan pages with names like “In Trump We Trust.” I complied.



### Buying Myself Back. When does a model own her own image?

[*from The Cut, 15/09/20*](https://www.thecut.com/article/emily-ratajkowski-owning-my-image-essay.html)

I posted the photograph of me using the bouquet as a shield on my Instagram because I liked what it said about my relationship with the paparazzi, and now I was being sued for it. I’ve become more familiar with seeing myself through the paparazzi’s lenses than I am with looking at myself in the mirror.
