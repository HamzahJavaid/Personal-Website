I use this post series to summarize my readings in the last week. I collect both news articles on present events and older articles I discovered during the last seven days. 

## Old

### New 'TheirTube' tool reveals how YouTube appears to other people

[*from The Independent, 17/07/20*](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/youtube-bias-algorithm-theirtube-mozilla-conspiracy-theory-videos-a9624936.html)

A new tool has demonstrated how YouTube's secretive recommendation algorithm directs users to videos promoting extremist ideologies and conspiracy theories. [...] The tool shows how the world’s most popular video-sharing platform looks like to people from different political demographics, such as conservatives and liberals, as well as other personas like fruitarians, climate change deniers and ‘prepper’ survivalists.

### Regulating Technology

[*from Ben Evans' blog, 23/07/20*](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/7/23/regulating-technology)

Tech has gone from being just one of many industries to being systemically important to society. My old colleague Marc Andreessen liked to say that ‘software is eating the world’ - well, it did. [...] When something is systemically important to society and has systemically important problems, this brings attention from governments and regulators. [...] All companies have to follow employment law, and accounting law, and workplace safety law, and indeed criminal law. But some also have their own laws as well, because they have some very specific and important questions that need them. 

### We Are Tracking What Happens to Police After They Use Force on Protestors

[*from ProPublica, 29/07/20*](https://projects.propublica.org/protest-police-videos/)

These 68 videos show clear apparent instances of police officers escalating violence during protests. Most departments refused to share details about investigations and discipline or even officers’ names. Here’s what we learned about each case.

### The eight most outrageous things cities did to lure Amazon for HQ2

[*from The Verge, 19/10/17*](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16504042/amazon-hq2-second-headquarters-most-funny-crazy-pitches-proposals-stonecrest-new-york)

Bids for Amazon’s second headquarters are due today, and all the vying North American cities interested in luring Amazon’s business have sent in their pitches. While some more conventional cities like Charlotte, North Carolina, offered up proposals of 20 possible locations for an Amazon campus in a carved wooden box, others truly went the extra mile, revealing maybe too much desperation.

### Destroying trust in the media, science, and government has left America vulnerable to disaster

[*from The Brookings Institute 01/05/20*](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/05/01/destroying-trust-in-the-media-science-and-government-has-left-america-vulnerable-to-disaster/)

For America to minimize the damage from the current pandemic, the media must inform, science must innovate, and our government must administer like never before. Yet decades of politically-motivated attacks discrediting all three institutions, taken to a new level by President Trump, leave the American public in a vulnerable position.



## News

### Congress forced Silicon Valley to answer for its misdeeds

[*from The Guardian, 30/07/20*](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/30/congress-forced-silicon-valley-to-answer-for-its-misdeeds-it-was-a-glorious-sight)

Over and over, the CEOs had similar answers. I don’t know. I’ll get back to you. I’m not aware of that. Or long rambling attempts to deflect, followed by members of Congress cutting them off to get answers to crisp questions. 

### LAPD ‘SWAT Mafia’ encouraged excessive force and retaliation, officer’s suit claims

[*from the Los Angeles Times 29/07/20*](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-29/lapd-swat-unit-controlled-by-swat-mafia-that-encourages-deadly-shootings-sergeant-lawsuit-alleges)

A longtime Los Angeles police SWAT sergeant is suing the LAPD, alleging the unit is run by a “SWAT Mafia” of veteran cops who encourage the use of deadly force and ostracized him for revealing its behavior.

### Anti-fascists linked to zero murders in the US in 25 years

[*from The Guardian, 27/07/20*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/us-rightwing-extremists-attacks-deaths-database-leftwing-antifa)

As Trump rails against ‘far-left’ fascism, new database shows leftwing attacks have left far fewer people dead than violence by rightwing extremists.

### Lawyers Demand the Military Stop Violating Free Speech on Twitch

[*from The New York Times, 22/07/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/style/army-gamers-war-crimes-first-amendment.html)

Army and Navy channels banned viewers from their live streams when they asked about war crimes. Accused of censorship, now the Army says it will pause streaming.

### Slack Accuses Microsoft of Illegally Crushing Competition

[*from The New York Times, 22/07/20*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/technology/slack-microsoft-antitrust.html)

Slack claims that Microsoft has illegally tied its collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, to its dominant suite of productivity programs, Microsoft Office, which includes Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. That bundling tactic, Slack contends, is part of a pattern of anticompetitive behavior by Microsoft.
