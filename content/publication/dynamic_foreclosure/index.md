abstract: The widespread of data to make personalized products has generated new synergies across markets increasing the degree of market complementarity and the risk of foreclosure. At the same time, data promotes economies of scale that are often argued to be responsible for market tipping. This paper uses modern computational tools to nest the classical foreclosure literature into a broader framework to study market dynamics in data-intense industries. We show how firm bundling could statically bring higher consumer welfare through tougher competition, but dynamics push the market structure towards monopoly. Moreover, this paper analyzes how these dynamics interact with economy-of-scale technologies such as learning-by-doing. We show that while bundling increases firm ability to integrate, learning-by-doing increases firm incentives to integrate. Together they transform "competition in the market" into "competition for the market". 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We use computational theory to look at market dynamics in presence of complementarities and learning-by-doing. We show the importance of looking at long term dynamics in competition policy. For example, the conventional conclusion that mergers of complements are welfare improving is true in the short run but it can lead to market tipping in the long run.
